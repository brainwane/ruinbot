Ruinbot
=======

Ruinbot uses [python-twitter](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter) to 
produce [@RuinRobot](https://twitter.com/RuinRobot), a bot that tweets 
predictions of wince-inducing covers, mashups, and remakes.

The horror prediction generator grabs random titles, possible parodists and 
ignominious fates, and probable delays and mixes them into tweets such as:

> In 2027, Saturday morning cartoons will film Seinfeld.

> In 2040, MAD Magazine will comic book-ify Interpreter of Maladies.

> In 2033, Muzak will co-opt We Are Young.
